      <p>
        I am from the blue mountains of the Shenandoah Valley and have a
        deep-running love for American and Irish folk music, solidarity
        politics, breakfasts of all kinds, and economix (i.e., economics done
        differently, like in cooperatively-owned businesses). As I lived in
        Nashville, TN and built relationships with other Southerners, I
        increasingly felt a sense of place and purpose in the South. In 2016, I
        made a home in Selma, AL, where there are good folks and there's good
        work to be done. My wife and I moved to Durham in Nov. of 2021 with our
        new AL puppy, Inis, to start a next season closer to some family and
        friends.

        I am new to coding in many ways, though I have always been intrigued by
        technology. My Mom tells me that as a baby, she thought I might go into
        computer-related work one day. For me, my first formal involvement in
        tech-related work came through the cooperative sector--specifically
        through something called "platform cooperatives," where workers and
        users own the tech companies they make possible. I took a class through
        The New School and Mondgragon University in 2020 called "Platform
        Cooperatives Now." This led me into a volunteer project seeking to
        develop a co-op food delivery app. I was more involved in coordinating
        the volunteer software developers among us, but it gave me a taste for
        the grounded quality of building code and the role coding can play in a
        modern economy. I since applied and was accepted into Code the Dream in
        early 2022, where I am learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and related
        introductory skills, which will be followed by a course in Fall of 2022
        in either React.js or Node.js.
